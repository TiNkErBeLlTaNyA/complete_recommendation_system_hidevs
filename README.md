# Complete Recommendation System with API

## Project Overview

A production-ready hybrid recommendation system built using FastAPI, SQLite, and machine learning techniques. The system delivers personalized recommendations using collaborative, content-based, and popularity-based strategies.

---

##  Features

* Hybrid ML Recommendation Engine
* Collaborative + Content-Based + Popularity Filtering
* Cold Start Handling
* Explainable Recommendations
* FastAPI REST API
* Interactive Dashboard UI
* Evaluation Metrics (Precision@5, Recall@5, NDCG@5)
* Request Logging & Caching

##  Architecture

User → API → Orchestrator → Candidate Generator → Scorer → Database → Response

##  Setup Instructions

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m scripts.seed_data
uvicorn api.app:app --reload
```

---

## Database Schema

The system uses a normalized SQLite database with the following tables:

### Users
- id (Primary Key)
- name
- interests
- created_at

### Content
- id (Primary Key)
- title
- category
- difficulty
- popularity

### Skills
- id (Primary Key)
- name

### User_Skills
- user_id (Foreign Key → Users.id)
- skill_id (Foreign Key → Skills.id)
- proficiency

### Content_Skills
- content_id (Foreign Key → Content.id)
- skill_id (Foreign Key → Skills.id)

### Interactions
- user_id (Foreign Key → Users.id)
- content_id (Foreign Key → Content.id)
- type
- rating
- created_at

---

##  API Endpoints

* **GET /recommend/{user_id}** → Get recommendations
* **POST /feedback** → Record feedback
* **GET /metrics** → System statistics
* **GET /health** → Health check
* **GET /ui** → Dashboard UI

---

##  Recommendation Logic

Hybrid scoring:

```
0.5 × collaborative + 0.3 × content + 0.2 × popularity
```

---

##  Evaluation

Run:

```bash
python -m scripts.evaluate
```

Metrics used:

* Precision@5
* Recall@5
* NDCG@5
